Program expects two paths as arguments. These will be recursively searched for test case reports and referred to as left and right respectively.
Program output can be influenced with properties whose precedence is as follows:
 - properties provided in command line/programmatically
 - a property file from the current directory named default.properties
 - hardcoded properties from within this JAR archive
Properties:
 - test.diff.verbose e {true,false} verbose output
 - test.diff.output.show.{common,left,right} e {true,false} shows common, left or right part of the result
 - test.diff.output.filter.{common,left,right} - if property exists filtering per status is active - true will show only successful test, false only non successful test
